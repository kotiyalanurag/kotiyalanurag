# üëãüèª About me

<p>Hi there! I'm a full-time master's student at RWTH Aachen University, where I study Computer Science. Currently, I'm working on my thesis at CAISA Lab which is situated in Bonn, Germany.

My interests span across data science, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I'm passionate about leveraging new technologies to solve real-world problems and am always eager to learn and explore new things in the field.

Feel free to check out my projects and you can reach out to me on kotiyalanurag at gmail.</p>
